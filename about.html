                    Hello! I'm Pratham Rana, a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Trident Academy of Technology, Bhubaneswar. My passion lies in creating impactful solutions through AI and ML, and I have hands-on experience in Python programming, frontend development, and various machine learning frameworks.
                    <span id="moreText" style="display: none;">
                        I have completed an internship at YBI Foundation and developed projects including a personal voice assistant, Jarvis.ai, and multiple websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and other frontend tools. I'm actively seeking a career as a Machine Learning Engineer to further my expertise in this field and apply my skills in real-world applications.
